<h1 align="center"> RabbitMQ Server </h1>

 <p align="center">RabbitMQ Server is performance testing tool, written on C#, which allows to test sending and receiving capability  (messages per second) of different client applications.
Currently it can be configured to simulate workload of C# application. But it can be extended to test other consumers and producers of messages such as SQL Server Integration Services.
Here is very interesting topic about [how to post messages to RabbitMQ from SQL Server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35748700/how-to-post-messages-to-rabbitmq-from-sql-server).
