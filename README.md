RabbitMQ Server is performance testing tool that allows to test sending and receiving capability (messages per second) of different client applications.

Currently it can be configured to simulate workload of C# application. But it can be extended to test other consumers and producers of messages such as SQL Server Integration Services.

Here is very interesting question on StackOverflow [about how to post messages to RabbitMQ from SQL Server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35748700/how-to-post-messages-to-rabbitmq-from-sql-server).
